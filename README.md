# Playing-Cards-Computer-Vision
I trained a model using TensorFlow to detect the suit and number of a playing card given its image. I created my own dataset by taking pictures of each card, then performed pre-processing and data augmentation using rotate, zoom, brighten, and shear functions. My final dataset consisted of 39000, 180x180 grayscale images. I then trained a convolutional neural network to classify the card images.
